Virtual DOM
Another notable feature is the use of a virtual Document Object Model, or virtual DOM.
React creates an in-memory data-structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and then updates the browser's displayed DOM efficiently.[11] This process is called reconciliation. This allows the programmer to write code as if the entire page is rendered on each change, while the React libraries only render subcomponents that actually change.
This selective rendering provides a major performance boost.[12] It saves the effort of
recalculating the CSS style, layout for the page and rendering for the entire page.[12]
Lifecycle methods
Lifecycle methods for class-based components use a form of hooking that allows the
execution of code at set points during a component's lifetime.
shouldComponentUpdate allows the developer to prevent unnecessary re-rendering
of a component by returning false if a render is not required.
componentDidMount is called once the component has mounted (the component
has been created in the user interface, often by associating it with a DOM node). This is commonly used to trigger data loading from a remote source via an API.
componentWillUnmount is called immediately before the component is torn down or
unmounted. This is commonly used to clear resource-demanding dependencies to the component that will not simply be removed with the unmounting of the component (e.g., removing any setInterval() instances that are related to the component, or an eventListener
set on the document because of the presence of the component)
render is the most important lifecycle method and the only required one in any
component. It is usually called every time the component's state is updated, which should be reflected in the user interface.
JS
Main article: JSX
JSX, or JavaScript Syntax Extension, is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax.[13]
Similar in appearance to HTML, JSX provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar to many developers. React components are typically written using JSX,
although they do not have to be (components may also be written in pure JavaScript). JSX is
similar to another extension syntax created by Facebook for PHP called XHP.
