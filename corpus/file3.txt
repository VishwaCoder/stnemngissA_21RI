Puran poli is a sweet flatbread that is traditionally made during Ganesha Chaturthi, a Hindu festival celebrating the birthday of Lord Ganesha, son of Shiva and Parvati. Originating from the state of Maharashtra, the flatbread consists of flour, turmeric powder, salt, water and ghee (Indian clarified butter), and the sweet filling consists of yellow gram lentils, jaggery (cane sugar) and cardamom powder.

The name of the dish refers to the stuffing called puran, while the outer layer (flatbread) is called poli. Puran poli can be made three to four days in advance and is usually eaten hot, for breakfast, as a snack, or as a dessert after the main meal.
