Kachori is a spicy Indian snack shaped like a round flattened ball, consisting of a flour-based shell with different fillings. The most popular filling consists of yellow moong dal, besan flour, pepper, chili powder, cumin seeds, and other spices.

Kachori is most popular in Indian states such as Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Punjab. The snack has numerous variations in each state, so dried fruits, nuts, and coconut are sometimes added to kachori in order to enhance its flavors.

In Delhi, it is typically served with curd, tamarind chutney, and onion rings.
